I would like to use two grace days for this assignment.

Some quirks with this program is that it does not read the s2.txt file provided. I believe it to be caused by issues with newlines and the sort
While I have tried using strtok to resolve this, it doesn't work as expected, and I do not know of the reason for this differences definitively,
but I suspect it has to do with newlines and the different ways to read newlines.

The code on the Linux server is the most up-to-date, but I should have also submitted it as a zip file.
